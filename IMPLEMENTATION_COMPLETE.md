## Architecture Highlights

### **Defense-in-Depth RLS**
- Row-level security policies enforce domain/collection membership across all tables
- Policies cascade from domains → collections → tasks → attachments
- Audit logging captures all privileged mutations

### **Immutable Audit Trails**
- Triggers log domain/task/collection mutations with user context
- Audit log RLS ensures only owners/admins can view their domain's audit trail
- CSV export includes audit trail viewer for compliance

### **Feature-Gated Rollout**
- `central-hub-mvp` flag gates hub aggregation
- `calendar-overlay` flag gates calendar features
- `notifications-ui` flag gates notification center
- Enables safe phased rollout and A/B testing

### **Deterministic Correctness**
- Migrations establish schema and constraints
- RLS policies enforce access control
- Triggers maintain audit trails
- Tests validate contracts and RLS via regression harnesses

### **Accessibility-First**
- WCAG AA compliance across hub, domains, calendar, notifications
- Axe audits in test suites
- Keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, focus management
- Screen reader support and live regions
