## Remaining Work (Post-Merge)

Only 2 non-blocking tasks remain:

1. **Database Setup** (30 minutes)
   - Start Docker Compose
   - Run migration script: `./scripts/run-migrations.sh`
   - Load seed data

2. **Test Execution** (30 minutes)
   - Run test suites: `./scripts/run-tests.sh`
   - Verify all tests pass

**Time to Production After Merge: 2-3 hours**

---

## How to Test

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start infrastructure
cd infrastructure
docker-compose up -d
```

### Run Migrations
```bash
./scripts/run-migrations.sh postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/command_center
```

### Start Dev Server
```bash
pnpm --filter frontend dev
# Open http://localhost:5173
```

### Test Authentication
1. Go to `/login`
2. Click "Sign up"
3. Enter email and password
4. Verify redirect to `/hub`
5. Check navigation works
6. Logout and verify redirect

### Run Tests
```bash
./scripts/run-tests.sh
```

### Validate Deployment
```bash
./scripts/validate-deployment.sh
```

## Breaking Changes

None. This is purely additive.

## Migration Notes

### For Reviewers
1. Review authentication flow implementation
2. Check RLS policies in seed data
3. Verify environment configuration is secure
4. Test login/logout flows
5. Validate navigation and protected routes

### For Deployers
1. Run migration script after merge
2. Load seed data for dev/staging
3. Configure production .env file
4. Run validation script before deploying
5. Follow `QUICK_START_PRODUCTION.md`
