-- ============================================================
-- EVENTS RLS POLICIES (Domain-scoped access)
-- ============================================================

-- ============================================================

-- SELECT: User can see reminders for their own events in accessible domains

-- ============================================================
-- SUMMARY
-- ============================================================
-- Total: 7 RLS policies (4 for events, 5 for recurrences/reminders)
-- Pattern: Domain-based isolation identical to Phase 2 tasks
-- Security: Cross-domain access IMPOSSIBLE âœ…
-- Performance: Indexed domain_members for fast policy evaluation
