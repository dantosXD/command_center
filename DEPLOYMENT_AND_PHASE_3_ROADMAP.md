## IMMEDIATE: PHASE 2 DEPLOYMENT (TODAY)

### Step-by-Step Deployment

#### 1. Pre-Deployment Verification (30 minutes)
```bash
cd command_center

# Run all tests
npm test
# Expected: 55+ tests pass

# Type checking
npm --filter frontend check
# Expected: No errors

# Linting
npm --filter frontend lint
# Expected: No errors

# Production build
npm --filter frontend build
# Expected: dist/ folder with no errors
```

#### 2. Commit Sprint 3c Changes (15 minutes)
```bash
git add frontend/src/components/*.svelte
git add frontend/src/lib/utils/dates.ts
git add frontend/src/lib/shortcuts.ts
git add frontend/src/routes/tasks/+page.svelte
git add frontend/src/components/index.ts

git commit -m "feat: Phase 2 Sprint 3c - Task UI components

- Add TaskList, TaskListItem components
- Add TaskCreateDialog, TaskDeleteDialog dialogs
- Add date utilities and keyboard shortcuts
- All tests passing, A-grade code quality"

git push origin 001-central-hub
```

#### 3. Staging Deployment (1-2 hours)
```bash
# On your deployment platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.):
# 1. Create PR: 001-central-hub → main
# 2. Run CI/CD (tests + build)
# 3. Deploy to staging environment
# 4. Verify in staging:
#    - Navigate to /tasks page
#    - Create task (Cmd+N)
#    - Edit task
#    - Delete task (Cmd+D)
#    - Check no console errors
```

#### 4. Production Deployment (30 minutes - 1 hour)
```bash
# After staging approval:
# 1. Merge PR to main
# 2. Tag release: v0.2.0
# 3. Deploy to production
# 4. Monitor:
#    - Error rate (target: <0.1%)
#    - P95 latency (target: <250ms)
#    - RLS violations (target: 0)

git tag v0.2.0
git push origin v0.2.0
```

6. Test thoroughly
7. Re-deploy with approval

### If Phase 3 Takes Longer Than Expected
1. Prioritize: Core calendar CRUD first
2. Defer: ICS import/export to Phase 3.5
3. Defer: Advanced recurrence patterns to Phase 4
4. Escalate: More developer resources
5. Adjust timeline
