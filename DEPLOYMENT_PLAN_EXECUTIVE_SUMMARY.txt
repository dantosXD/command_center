COMMAND CENTER MVP: DEPLOYMENT & TESTING PLAN - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

PROJECT: Command Center - Unified productivity hub for work and life management
STATUS:  70% SCAFFOLDED AND READY FOR PHASE 3 (HUB MVP) IMPLEMENTATION
BRANCH:  001-central-hub
SCOPE:   Phases 1-3 only (Hub aggregation + search, no calendar/notifications)
TIMELINE: 7-10 business days to production deployment

================================================================================
CURRENT STATE (WHAT'S COMPLETE)
================================================================================

INFRASTRUCTURE ✅ COMPLETE
  - Docker Compose stack: Postgres, Supabase, SeaweedFS, Postal, Redis, Prometheus, Grafana
  - All required services containerized and networked
  - Health checks and dependency ordering configured

DATABASE SCHEMA ✅ COMPLETE
  - 13 migrations covering:
    * Core tables (workspace, domain, collection, task, event, attachment)
    * RLS policies for workspace/domain isolation
    * Audit logging and compliance tracking
    * Search indexes and materialized views for hub aggregation
    * Feature flag infrastructure
  - All critical tables have RLS enabled
  - Audit triggers configured for privileged action logging

FRONTEND SCAFFOLDING ✅ COMPLETE
  - SvelteKit 2.x application with all dependencies
  - Component library: Radix UI, Lucide icons, TailwindCSS
  - Store architecture: Svelte stores + TanStack Query ready
  - Routes structure established
  - Supabase JS client singleton configured
  - Test infrastructure: Vitest + Playwright

PROJECT ORGANIZATION ✅ COMPLETE
  - Monorepo with pnpm workspaces
  - GitHub Actions CI pipeline stub
  - Documentation folder structure (ADRs, operations runbooks)
  - Tests folder with contract, RLS, and e2e structure
  - Environment configuration templates

================================================================================
CRITICAL GAPS (BLOCKING MVP) - 5 MAJOR ITEMS
================================================================================

1. AUTHENTICATION FLOW (Effort: 8 hours)
   Status: Partially stubbed
   Impact: Users cannot access application

   Missing:
   - Login page form (email/password with Supabase GoTrue)
   - OAuth callback handler (session management, token refresh)
   - Logout endpoint (session clearing)
   - Auth store (reactive current user, session validation)
   - Server-side hooks middleware (protect (app)/* routes, validate JWT)

   Deliverable: Users can sign in, get redirected to /hub, can logout

2. DATABASE SEEDING (Effort: 3 hours)
   Status: Not created
   Impact: No test data for development

   Missing:
   - Seed script (backend/supabase/seeds/dev.sql)
   - Test workspace, domains, users, sample tasks/events
   - Feature flags initialization

   Deliverable: Test data exists, RLS isolation verified

3. HUB BACKEND APIS (Effort: 8 hours)
   Status: Migrations exist; RPC functions stubbed
   Impact: No data aggregation for hub

   Missing:
   - hub-feed RPC: Aggregate tasks/events, apply RLS, feature flags
   - hub-search RPC: Text search + filters (status, priority, domain, date)
   - Contract tests (verify RPC signatures, response types)
   - RLS tests (user isolation validation)

   Deliverable: Curl commands return JSON with correct data, tests pass

4. HUB FRONTEND UI (Effort: 12 hours)
   Status: Component scaffolds exist; logic missing
   Impact: No visual interface for hub

   Missing:
   - Hub page (Today/Upcoming/By Domain sections)
   - Hub store with TanStack Query integration
   - Search panel with filter drawer
   - Command palette (Cmd+K) with NLP parser
   - Real-time subscription store (WebSocket updates)

   Deliverable: /hub displays tasks/events, domain filter works, search/quick-add functional

5. TESTING & CI/CD (Effort: 8 hours)
   Status: Structure exists; tests and pipeline not implemented
   Impact: No automated validation, no deployment confidence

   Missing:
   - Unit tests (hubStore, nlp.ts, utilities)
   - E2E tests (sign in → hub → search → quick-add → realtime)
   - RLS isolation tests (cross-domain access prevention)
   - Accessibility tests (WCAG 2.2 AA compliance)
   - GitHub Actions CI workflow

   Deliverable: All tests pass, CI/CD green on every commit

================================================================================
ESTIMATED EFFORT & TIMELINE
================================================================================

Phase 1-2: Foundation (Partially Done)
  Auth + Seeding                8 hours  (Days 1-2)
  Database validation           2 hours
  Subtotal                     10 hours

Phase 3: Hub MVP (To Be Implemented)
  Hub backend RPCs              8 hours  (Days 3)
  Hub frontend UI              12 hours  (Days 4-5)
  Testing suite                 8 hours  (Days 6)
  CI/CD setup                   3 hours  (Days 6)
  Polish & documentation        4 hours  (Day 7)
  Subtotal                     35 hours

TOTAL MVP EFFORT:            ~45-50 hours
RECOMMENDED TEAM:            1-2 developers
REALISTIC TIMELINE:          7-10 business days

================================================================================
CONSTITUTION COMPLIANCE (7 Core Principles - 7/7 REQUIRED)
================================================================================

I.   DETERMINISTIC CORRECTNESS
     - Red-green-refactor: Tests before implementation
     - All changes start with failing tests
     Status: PLANNED - implement in testing phase

II.  DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH WITH ROW-LEVEL SECURITY
     - Every table has explicit RLS policies
     - Secrets in vault, never in .env
     - Threat models before new surfaces
     Status: READY - RLS policies exist, need validation tests

III. ACCESSIBLE BY DEFAULT
     - WCAG 2.2 AA compliance validated
     - Keyboard-only navigation tested
     - Accessibility regressions block merge
     Status: PLANNED - Axe scans + manual audit in testing phase

IV.  INCREMENTAL DELIVERY BEHIND FEATURE FLAGS
     - central-hub-mvp flag controls rollout
     - Automatic rollback on error budget violation
     Status: READY - feature flag infrastructure exists

V.   IDEMPOTENT AND RECOVERABLE OPERATIONS
     - Background jobs safely retryable
     - No side effects on retry
     Status: PLANNED - validate in RPC implementation

VI.  REPRODUCIBLE BUILD & RELEASE PIPELINE
     - Pinned dependencies (pnpm lockfiles)
     - Deterministic CI/CD, artifact provenance
     Status: READY - pnpm lockfile committed, CI config pending

VII. COMPREHENSIVE TEST DISCIPLINE
     - Unit + contract + RLS + e2e + a11y coverage
     - Tests mandatory before merge
     - CI fails without complete test suites
     Status: PLANNED - comprehensive test suite in days 5-6
