# Feature Specification: Command Center Hub MVP

**Feature Branch**: `001-central-hub`  
**Created**: 2025-10-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "/speckit.specify You are building a “Command Center” web app that functions as a CENTRAL HUB for work and life. Purpose: unify lists, projects, tasks, events, meetings, and notes; schedule reminders/notifications. Key concepts: - Workspaces → Domains (e.g., Home, Work, Play) → Collections (Projects, Lists, Calendars) → Items (Tasks, Events, Notes). - CENTRAL HUB view aggregates across all Domains; user can also focus a single Domain. - Tasks: title, description (rich text), status [backlog/in-progress/blocked/done], priority, assignees, labels, due/start/completed, recurrence (RRULE), dependencies, subtasks, checklists, attachments, comments. - Events/Meetings: title, start/end, timezone, attendees, reminders, recurrence (RRULE), links to tasks/projects, notes. - Calendars: day/week/month views; multi-calendar overlay; natural-language quick add. - Notifications: in-app + email (MVP); later chat/webhooks. Triggers: due/overdue, assignment, mentions, status changes, event reminders. - Collaboration: comments with @mentions, presence, optimistic updates; CRDT only for notes later if needed. - Search & Filters: full-text + structured filters (assignee, status, due range, project, DOMAIN). - Reporting: minimal MVP dashboard (overdue, upcoming, velocity proxy), CSV export. - Admin & Permissions: roles (Owner/Admin/Member/Guest). Domain visibility (private/shared/workspace). Audit log. Accessibility & UX: - Keyboard-first (command palette), drag-drop, focus states, high contrast theme. - Domain switcher (Home/Work/Play/All Domains). Hub shows Today/Upcoming, meetings, quick-add. Non-goals for MVP: - Deep video-conferencing, enterprise SSO/SCIM, advanced dashboards, complex rules engine (ship 3–5 canned automations instead). Acceptance criteria (MVP): - Create Domain, Project, Tasks (incl. recurrence), and Events. - See tasks/events in calendar; receive reminders in user’s local time (email + in-app). - Central Hub can toggle “All Domains” vs specific domain. - RLS prevents cross-domain data leaks; audit log records privileged actions. - Export CSV (tasks) and ICS (calendars). Basic Slack outbound webhook works."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Focused Daily Hub (Priority: P1)

As a user I want a single hub that aggregates today’s tasks, upcoming meetings, and quick-add shortcuts across domains so I can plan my day without switching tools.

**Why this priority**: The daily hub is the core value proposition and must exist before any other feature.

**Independent Test**: Sign in as a user with data across domains, toggle hub between All Domains and a focused domain, and validate accurate aggregation and quick-add interactions without visiting other pages.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user with tasks and events across domains, **When** they open the hub in "All Domains" mode, **Then** they see a combined view sorted by due/start time with domain indicators.
2. **Given** a user viewing the hub, **When** they switch to the "Work" domain, **Then** only Work collections/items appear and the hub retains Today/Upcoming widgets and quick-add for Work.
3. **Given** the hub today, **When** the user invokes the command palette and adds a task via natural language, **Then** the task is created in the active domain with parsed dates and priority reflected immediately in the hub list.

---

### User Story 2 - Domain & Collection Management (Priority: P1)

As a workspace owner I want to create domains, projects, lists, and calendars with appropriate visibility so teams can organize work without leaking data.

**Why this priority**: Without domain scaffolding the hub cannot segment data or enforce security controls.

**Independent Test**: Create domains and collections with varied permissions, invite members with different roles, and verify visibility in hub and domain-specific views.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an owner, **When** they create a new "Play" domain and mark it private, **Then** only invited members can see its collections and items anywhere in the app.
2. **Given** a shared domain, **When** an admin adds a project and assigns members, **Then** the project appears in the domain sidebar and members receive notifications.
3. **Given** a domain calendar, **When** a member links a task to an event, **Then** the relationship appears in both task detail and event sidebar.

---

### User Story 3 - Calendar & Reminder Integrity (Priority: P2)

As a planner I want tasks and events synchronized with calendars, time zones, and reminders so deadlines are honored regardless of locale.

**Why this priority**: Calendar overlays and reminders deliver the MVP acceptance criteria for scheduling.

**Independent Test**: Create recurring tasks and events, confirm calendar overlays and notifications trigger in local time, and validate exports.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a recurring task with due time, **When** the next occurrence approaches, **Then** an in-app and email reminder fires in the assignee’s time zone.
2. **Given** linked calendars for multiple domains, **When** the user views the month calendar, **Then** events display color-coded by domain with natural-language entries placed correctly.
3. **Given** a week of scheduled items, **When** the user exports ICS, **Then** the file contains events with correct RRULE metadata and can be imported into external calendars.

### User Story 4 - Collaboration & Tracking (Priority: P3)

As a collaborator I want comments, mentions, and dashboard summaries so teams stay aligned and can action items quickly.

**Why this priority**: Collaboration and reporting ensure the hub supports multi-user adoption while keeping scope focused.

**Independent Test**: Two members comment, mention, and update statuses while reviewing dashboards and audit logs to verify traceability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a task with multiple assignees, **When** a member leaves a comment with @mention, **Then** the mentioned user receives notification and the comment appears in task history.
2. **Given** workspace activity, **When** an admin reviews the audit log, **Then** privileged actions (role changes, visibility edits) display with timestamps and actor information.
3. **Given** the reporting dashboard, **When** overdue tasks exist, **Then** they are highlighted with counts by domain and velocity trend is calculated from completed tasks per week.

### Edge Cases

- User changes system time zone after scheduling recurring events -> notifications and calendar export must rebase to new zone without duplicating events.
- Two members edit the same rich-text note concurrently -> last write wins with optimistic UI; CRDT deferred.
- Task dependencies form a circular reference -> system rejects save with guidance to break loop.
- Feature flag disabled mid-session -> hub modules respect flag and hide beta widgets without error.

### Accessibility & Compliance Notes *(mandatory)*

- Accessibility: Provide WCAG 2.2 AA compliant UI with keyboard traversal for hub, domain switcher, calendar, and command palette; include ARIA labels and high-contrast theme toggle.
- Accessibility: Automate accessibility scanning in CI and schedule manual audits for focus order, colour contrast, and drag-drop alternatives.
- Security: Enforce per-domain Row-Level Security with tenant scoping on every query and redact cross-domain references in notifications.
- Security: Run threat model sessions for notifications and exports; store audit logs immutably for one year.
- Privacy: Persist user preferences with consent, allow reminder opt-outs, and log access to private domains.
- Privacy: Email reminders must include unsubscribe footer aligned with CAN-SPAM/GDPR compliance and respect locale formatting.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow workspace owners to create, rename, archive, and restore domains with visibility options (private, shared, workspace-wide).
- **FR-002**: System MUST support projects, lists, and calendars within each domain, including assignment of roles per collection.
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to create and manage tasks with rich text, status, priority, assignees, labels, due/start/completed dates, recurrence (RRULE), dependencies, subtasks, checklists, attachments, and comments.
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to create events/meetings with time zone handling, attendees, recurrence, reminders, and links to related tasks/projects.

- **FR-006**: Calendar views MUST provide day/week/month layouts, multi-calendar overlays, drag/drop scheduling, and natural-language quick add for tasks/events.
- **FR-007**: Notification system MUST deliver in-app and email alerts for due/overdue tasks, assignments, mentions, status changes, and event reminders in recipient locale.
- **FR-008**: Reporting dashboard MUST surface overdue counts, upcoming workload, lightweight velocity proxy, and export tasks to CSV plus calendars to ICS.
- **FR-009**: System MUST integrate a basic Slack outbound webhook for task and event notifications with scope-limited payloads.
- **FR-010**: Search MUST combine full-text and structured filters (assignee, status, due range, project, domain) with saved filter capability.
- **FR-011**: Collaboration MUST support comments with @mentions, presence indicators, optimistic updates, and activity timelines per item.
- **FR-012**: Audit log MUST capture privileged actions (role changes, visibility edits, exports) with timestamp, actor, and domain context.
- **FR-013**: Export flows MUST respect domain-level permissions and produce sanitized CSV/ICS files.
- **FR-014**: System MUST localize dates, times, and reminders according to user preferences.
- **FR-015**: Users MUST access a keyboard-first command palette covering creation, navigation, and quick filters.

### Security & Resilience Requirements

- **SR-001**: Implement domain-scoped Row-Level Security policies for all items, collections, notifications, exports, and search indices.
- **SR-002**: Ensure reminder dispatchers, recurring job generators, and export pipelines are idempotent and retry-safe with deduplicated delivery logs.
- **SR-003**: Store integration secrets (email provider, Slack webhook credentials) in managed vaults and mask them in logs/configs.
- **SR-004**: Provide quarterly disaster recovery drills validating restore of domains, calendars, and reminders within Recovery Time Objective agreed by governance.
- **SR-005**: Maintain immutable audit trails and alert on unexpected cross-domain access attempts.

### Delivery & Feature Flag Strategy

- **FF-001**: MVP ships behind `central-hub-mvp` feature flag with per-domain overrides for pilot users.
- **FF-002**: Rollout cohorts progress from internal team → pilot customers → general release, with automatic rollback if error budgets exceed threshold or RLS violations detected.
- **FF-003**: Flag must be removed within one milestone post-GA; sunset plan includes data migration for beta-specific collections.
- **FF-004**: Calendar overlays and reporting widgets sit behind granular flags (`calendar-overlay`, `mvp-dashboard`) to enable staged activation.

### Testing Strategy *(mandatory)*

- **TS-001**: Unit tests covering hub aggregation logic, recurrence parsing, and natural-language quick add parser with ownership documented per module.
- **TS-002**: Contract tests verifying task, event, notification, and export APIs including Slack webhook payload schema.
- **TS-003**: Row-Level Security tests simulating cross-domain access, shared calendars, and notification delivery to ensure isolation.
- **TS-004**: E2E smoke tests validating daily hub flow, calendar overlay interactions, reminder delivery, and CSV/ICS exports.
- **TS-005**: Accessibility test suite executing keyboard navigation, screen reader announcements, and high-contrast visual snapshots.

### Documentation & ADRs

- **DOC-001**: ADR "command-center-architecture" to document domain hierarchy, data model, and security posture.
- **DOC-002**: ADR "notification-pipeline" to capture reminder dispatch design and idempotency approach.
- **DOC-003**: Update operational runbooks with feature flag states, reminder schedules, and escalation procedures.
- **DOC-004**: Maintain release notes summarizing flag rollout stage and export capability status.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Workspace**: Top-level container holding domains, members with roles (Owner/Admin/Member/Guest), and global settings (timezone defaults, integrations).
- **Domain**: Scoped grouping (Home, Work, Play) containing collections, permission settings, and colour identity references.
- **Collection**: Project, List, or Calendar metadata including ownership, visibility, and linkages to items.
- **Task**: Work item with status, rich description, scheduling metadata, recurrence rules, dependencies, subtasks, checklists, attachments, comments, and audit history.
- **Event**: Calendar entry with start/end, timezone, attendees, reminders, notes, and references to linked tasks/projects.
- **Notification**: Delivery artifact capturing trigger type, recipient, channel (in-app/email/Slack), status, and audit link.
- **Audit Log Entry**: Record of privileged action with actor, timestamp, domain context, and before/after state summary.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 90% of pilot users complete daily planning (review Today list + schedule at least one item) within 5 minutes using the hub.
- **SC-002**: 95% of reminders (in-app + email) are delivered within 1 minute of scheduled trigger across supported time zones.
- **SC-003**: Calendar overlays render under 1.5 seconds for up to 5 concurrent domain calendars (95th percentile).
- **SC-004**: Less than 0.1% of cross-domain access attempts result in unauthorized data exposure (validated via automated RLS tests and audit review).
- **SC-005**: 80% of tasks created in beta export correctly to CSV and ICS without manual correction during user acceptance testing.

## Assumptions

- Authentication and billing are handled by the existing platform; this feature focuses on productivity workflows.
- Email delivery leverages an existing transactional email provider with templating support.
- Slack webhook integration is limited to outbound notifications to a single workspace channel per domain in MVP.
- CRDT-based collaborative notes are deferred; optimistic updates suffice for MVP.
