## Start Implementation Now

**Option 1: Using SpecKit Workflow**
```
/speckit.implement
```

This will:
- Verify prerequisites (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md exist)
- Check checklist completion status
- Execute tasks in phase order
- Track completion (mark tasks with [x])

**Option 2: Manual Execution**
```bash
# Ensure on correct branch
git checkout 001-central-hub

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start Phase 1
cd frontend && pnpm dev
```

---

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1**: 1-2 days (setup)
- **Phase 2**: 3-4 days (infrastructure)
- **Phase 3**: 2-3 days (hub)
- **Phase 4**: 3-4 days (domains/tasks)
- **Phase 5**: 3-4 days (calendar/reminders)
- **Phase 6**: 2-3 days (collaboration)
- **Phase 7**: 2-3 days (hardening)

**Total**: ~11 weeks for full MVP
